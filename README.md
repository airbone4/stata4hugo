# rmd-to-ipynb

VS Code extension (TypeScript) to convert R Markdown / Markdown files to Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).

Usage:
- Open a `.md` or `.Rmd` file in VS Code.
- Run the command `Convert R/Markdown to Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)` from the command palette.

This scaffold includes a very small converter that maps markdown blocks and fenced code blocks to notebook cells. It is intentionally minimal â€” extend it for better parsing and language handling.

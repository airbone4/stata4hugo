# 目的
寫一個vscode extension 用途是 轉 rmarkdown/makdown to Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).


Usage:
- Open a `.md` or `.Rmd` file in VS Code.
- Run the command `Convert R/Markdown to Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)` from the command palette.

This scaffold includes a very small converter that maps markdown blocks and fenced code blocks to notebook cells. It is intentionally minimal — extend it for better parsing and language handling.
